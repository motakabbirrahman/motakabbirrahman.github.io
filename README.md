#### _[PSO and ANN Based Hybrid MPPT Algorithm for Photovoltaic Array under Partial Shading Condition](https://abc.us.org/ojs/index.php/ei/article/view/481)_
<img src="/files/img/Representation_of_Partial_Shading_Situation_in_PV_Array.jpg" align="right" alt="PSO and ANN Based Hybrid MPPT Algorithm" width="350"/> 
Most of the conventional MPPT methods fail to track maximum power under partial shading condition (PSC). Partial shading is the most common situation in PV power generation, which is caused if part of the series-connected strings is partially shaded. This situation leads to the multiple peaks in the P-V characteristics curve of the PV system.
- Stochastic search method, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), is used instead of the conventional methods to track maximum power under PSC. But the PSO method has the limitation of slow operation.
- So in this project, a fast hybrid method is presented, which combines the PSO method with the ANN method.
- In this hybrid method, the ANN enables the existing PSO method to track MPP quickly by providing more accurate initial particle positions of the PSO algorithm. <br/>

#### _[Artificial Neural Network Based Maximum Power Point Tracking of a Photovoltaic System](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9303531)_
<img src="/files/img/Ann_based_MPPT.jpg" align="right" alt="ANN based MPPT" width="350"/> 
Nonlinear behavior of photovoltaic system under changing environmental conditions, creates the requirement of designing maximum power point tracker (MPPT). Conventionally perturb and observe (P&O) method and incremental conductance method have drawback of slow operation or low tracking efficiency. However, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) has been deployed for this purpose, as it can track the optimal operating point (MPP) quickly and accurately based on training data sets. 
- This paper presents three ANN based MPPT methods: Direct ANN, Cascaded ANN and the proposed Hybrid method.
- The ANN's are trained using training data set of maximum power point voltages (VMPP ) from a user defined PV array over different environmental conditions. <br/>
