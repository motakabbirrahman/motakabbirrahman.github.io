#### _[AC/off-grid photovoltaic powered open-source ball mill](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468067223000305)_
![Open-source Ball Mill](/files/img/ACoff-grid photovoltaic powered open-source ball mill.png) 
The open-source ball mill is fully customizable and designed to be fabricated with distributed manufacturing. The parametric designs of the main components are 3-D printable on a low-cost readily accessible RepRap-class fused filament 3-D printer, and the electronic parts, bearings, magnets, and balls are provided by a wide-range of of-the-shelf vendors. 
- The highly-customizable design of ball mill reduces the cost to <US$130 for an AC powered version and <US$315 for a switchable power that enables off-grid operation with a solar module and battery.
- The open-source ball mill is capable of reducing silicon particle sizes from the millimeter scale down to the nanometer scale.
- The open-source ball mill is also made with standard dimensions to work effectively and has been demonstrated to grind silicon particles from waste PV modules from 0.8 mm to 7 µm in 18 h. <br/>

#### _Design and control of dual active bridge converter cascaded with inverter to interface between low voltage DC grid and AC grid_
![DAB Inverter](/files/img/Design and control of dual active bridge converter cascaded with inverter to interface between low voltage DC grid and AC grid.png) 
The background of this project is to modify the existing DC nano grid by designing the interface between the nano grid and AC network. The idea is to supply energy to the AC grid when the nano grid is in power surplus mode. 
- In this project, the DAB cascaded with inverter topology has been designed which can be attached to a DC grid system as an interface with AC grid.
- Selection of transformer specifications, leakage inductance and conversion ratio in order to achieve ZVS operation for a wide range and reducing switching losses in dual active bridge converter.Hence, this DAB inverter has high efficiency.
- Designing the filters for the grid connected inverter and integrate it with the DAB.
- The simulations showed that, the DC capacitor voltage is maintained within the ZVS range in order ensure soft switching with a wide range of phase shift.



### Completed in 2021
#### _[Design and Simulation of Solar DC Nano Grid System from Bangladesh Perspective](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9528159)_ 
<img src="/files/img/Fig._2._Pictorial_representation_of_a_Nano_grid.jpg" align="right" alt="DC Nano Grid System"  width="350"/>
This research project proposes a model of DC Nano grid integrated with solar PV module which can supply electricity to up to 20 households at a distance of about 1 km. 
- Solar DC Nano grid can be a possible approach towards achieving electrification to certain areas where grid connectivity is still unavailable.
- It can generate and distribute power to a cluster of households at close proximity reliably.
- I this project simulation results of buck converters assigned to supply power at three different voltage levels to feed various domestic loads.
- The cost estimation is presented of the proposed model.

### Completed in 2020
#### _[PSO and ANN Based Hybrid MPPT Algorithm for Photovoltaic Array under Partial Shading Condition](https://abc.us.org/ojs/index.php/ei/article/view/481)_
Most of the conventional MPPT methods fail to track maximum power under partial shading condition (PSC). Partial shading is the most common situation in PV power generation, which is caused if part of the series-connected strings is partially shaded. This situation leads to the multiple peaks in the P-V characteristics curve of the PV system.
- Stochastic search method, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), is used instead of the conventional methods to track maximum power under PSC.
- But the PSO method has the limitation of slow operation.So in this project, a fast hybrid method is presented, which combines the PSO method with the ANN method.
- In this hybrid method, the ANN enables the existing PSO method to track MPP quickly by providing more accurate initial particle positions of the PSO algorithm. <br/>

### Completed in 2019
#### _[Protection of Power System during Cyber-Attack using Artificial Neural Network](https://abc.us.org/ojs/index.php/ei/article/view/478)_
Impacts of frequency and voltage disturbance on an isolated power system caused by cyber-attack has been discussed and a neural network-based protective approach has been proposed in this research work. <br/>

#### _[Artificial Neural Network Based Maximum Power Point Tracking of a Photovoltaic System](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9303531)_
Nonlinear behavior of photovoltaic system under changing environmental conditions, creates the requirement of designing maximum power point tracker (MPPT). Conventionally perturb and observe (P&O) method and incremental conductance method have drawback of slow operation or low tracking efficiency. However, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) has been deployed for this purpose, as it can track the optimal operating point (MPP) quickly and accurately based on training data sets. <br/>
