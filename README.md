He is also a member of Free Appropriate Sustainability Technology (FAST) research group, which focuses on the use of open source appropriate technology (OSAT) to find collaborative solutions to problems in sustainability and to reduce poverty under supervision of Professor [J.M.Pearce](https://www.appropedia.org/User:J.M.Pearce).
## Research Interest
His research interests include photovoltaic energy and power electronics focusing on the open source nanogrid design and control. During his undergraduate studies he worked on the maximum power tracking of solar cells using different neural networks and hybrid techniques. He believes that one-day solar power will dominate the field of electrical power generation, which is currently contributing only about 3% of overall electricity generation worldwide.

#### _PSO and ANN Based Hybrid MPPT Algorithm for Photovoltaic Array under Partial Shading Condition_
![PSO and ANN Based Hybrid MPPT Algorithm](/files/img/Representation_of_Partial_Shading_Situation_in_PV_Array.jpg) 
Most of the conventional MPPT methods fail to track maximum power under partial shading condition (PSC). Partial shading is the most common situation in PV power generation, which is caused if part of the series-connected strings is partially shaded. This situation leads to the multiple peaks in the P-V characteristics curve of the PV system.
- Stochastic search method, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), is used instead of the conventional methods to track maximum power under PSC. But the PSO method has the limitation of slow operation.
- So in this project, a fast hybrid method is presented, which combines the PSO method with the ANN method.
- In this hybrid method, the ANN enables the existing PSO method to track MPP quickly by providing more accurate initial particle positions of the PSO algorithm. <br/>

### Completed in 2019
#### _Protection of Power System during Cyber-Attack using Artificial Neural Network_
![Protection of Power System during Cyber-Attack](/files/img/Paper_2.jpg) 
Impacts of frequency and voltage disturbance on an isolated power system caused by cyber-attack has been discussed and a neural network-based protective approach has been proposed in this research work.
- Adaptive PID controllers for both load frequency control and automatic voltage regulator have been implemented using an artificial neural network-oriented by genetic algorithm.
- The parameters of the PID controller have been tuned offline by using a genetic algorithm over a wide range of system parameter variations. These data have been used to train the neural network.
- For load frequency control neural network tuned PID controller mitigate frequency disturbance 48% faster than manually tuned PID.
- For the automatic voltage regulator, neural network tuned PID controller mitigate voltage disturbance 70% faster than manually tuned PID during cyber-attack. <br/>

#### _Artificial Neural Network Based Maximum Power Point Tracking of a Photovoltaic System_
![ANN based MPPT](/files/img/Ann_based_MPPT.jpg) 
Nonlinear behavior of photovoltaic system under changing environmental conditions, creates the requirement of designing maximum power point tracker (MPPT). Conventionally perturb and observe (P&O) method and incremental conductance method have drawback of slow operation or low tracking efficiency. However, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) has been deployed for this purpose, as it can track the optimal operating point (MPP) quickly and accurately based on training data sets. 
- This paper presents three ANN based MPPT methods: Direct ANN, Cascaded ANN and the proposed Hybrid method.
- The ANN's are trained using training data set of maximum power point voltages (VMPP ) from a user defined PV array over different environmental conditions. <br/>
